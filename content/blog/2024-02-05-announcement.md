The joint CyberTraining team at ODU and the University of Arizona, led by PI Masha Sosonkina, is excited to announce **T3-CIDERS**, a new “train-the-trainer” program to accelerate the adoption of HPC and data-intensive techniques for cybersecurity research!

Cyberinfrastructure (CI) platforms and techniques such as advanced parallel computers, big data, and artificial intelligence are game changers in cutting-edge cybersecurity research. Presently, there is a significant gap in CI skills that hinder many students and interested researchers from participating in state-of-the-art cybersecurity and cyber-related research and development. Our Train-the-Trainer program aims to fill this gap by empowering faculty and research community members to effectively harness computational and data competencies for themselves while simultaneously growing the skills of students and other aspiring cybersecurity researchers.

The first **Summer Institute** will be held in-person at Old Dominion University Norfolk campus in early August, and open to participants across the Commonwealth of Virginia. More details will be announced later. We invite you to sign up for the [“T3-CIDERS Interest List”](https://odu.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3ZPARAHm2wK1D9Q) to receive updates and announcements from this new training program. Participating in this list will inform you of the availability of the training, invitation to join the cohort, our webinars and public events, and many more.

## T3-CIDERS Program in a Nutshell
T3-CIDERS invites faculty and researchers from qualified higher education institutions to participate as *“future trainers”* in our program.

In brief, the T3-CIDERS training program in academic year 2024–2025 will consist of:

- **Pre-training** (beginning in May): A series of virtual events and training programs to provide background knowledge and skills as an introduction to the technical contents of T3-CIDERS.
- **Summer Institute** (August): A week-long in-person program to inculcate instructional (pedagogical) skills to teach CI techniques to students in the context of cybersecurity research.
- **Local Training** (Fall 2024/Spring 2025): With the support from T3-CIDERS team, future trainers will plan and conduct local training events at their local institutions and/or communities to increase the uptake of CI techniques and platforms and enable rapid advances in cybersecurity and cyber-related research, development, and training.
- **Outreach to Local High Schools** (Fall 2024/Spring 2025): Future trainers are encouraged to offer outreach seminars or activities to increase awareness of cybersecurity research and CI among high school students, and draw their interest in pursuing careers in these fields.
- **Development of New CI Training Modules** (ongoing): Future trainers will collaboratively develop additional CI training modules that will accelerate research in new areas in cybersecurity and cyber-related areas.
Future trainers will become a part of a new community-of-practice for cybersecurity research leveraging advanced CI techniques and platforms.
