> We present a training program named T3-CIDERS, the Train- The-Trainer approach to fostering cyberinfrastructure (CI)- and Data-Enabled Research in CyberSecurity. T3-CIDERS is a train-the-trainer program for advanced cyberinfrastructure (CI) skills that is designed to be synergistic with research, teaching, and learning activities in cybersecurity and cyber-related disciplines. The participants, termed 'future trainers' (FTs), are trained in effective instructional design and CI hands-on materials from DeapSECURE, developed in a previous CyberTraining program. T3-CIDERS aims to enhance cybersecurity research and education through broader adoption of advanced CI techniques such as artificial intelligence, big data, parallel programming, and platforms like high-performance computing (HPC) systems. T3-CIDERS includes pre-training, a weeklong summer institute, ongoing learning engagements, and local training activities. The FTs conduct local training tailored to the needs at their respective home institutions. They will also develop a new CI training module (called 'Module X') based on the observed common needs in the cybersecurity research community. Community building is integral to T3-CIDERS as its overarching goal. The first cohort of FTs who took the 2024 summer institute comprises faculty members, researchers, and students representing multiple states.
