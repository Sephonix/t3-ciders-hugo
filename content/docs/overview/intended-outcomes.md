## Local Training
After attending the Summer Institute, T3-CIDERS participants are expected to offer at least one introductory CI training at their respective local institutions. This training may take various formats, such as the following:

- A hands-on workshop
- A webinar
- One-on-one or small group CI mentoring for research (example targets: research group members, student interns / research assistants)
- Inclusion of CI training materials into coursework and/or lab activities
- Creation of a new coursework based on CI training materials
- Competitions and hackathons

Other forms are possible. The specific kind of training to be conducted by a participant depends on the specific needs at the institution, the background of the students (or mentees), as well as the desired outcomes of the training. The T3-CIDERS team will provide support to the trainers in preparation, logistics, assessments of the local training events.

## High School Outreach
T3-CIDERS participants will also be encouraged to conduct outreach activities to local high schools to spread the awareness of cybersecurity research, as well as CI methods and tools.

## Additional CI Training Modules
T3-CIDERS participants will collaborative design and create additional training module(s) on prevailing CI techniques that are used in state-of-the-art cybersecurity research. This is part of a community building activity.
