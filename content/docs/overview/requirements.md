To be considered for participation in the program as a “Future Trainer” (FT), applicants must meet the following criteria:

1. **Academic Experiences**: FTs can be either full-time faculty members, staff members, postdoctoral researchers, or graduate students.
2. **Programming Proficiency**: All FTs must possess proficient problem-solving skills through computer programming in at least one language: C, C++, Java, R, or Python. A screening procedure will assess this competency.
3. **Communication and Experience**: FTs should demonstrate good communication skills and possess some teaching and/or research experience in relevant fields such as cybersecurity, computer science/engineering, and information technology.
4. **Commitment to Training**: FTs or their leading research faculty member must commit to becoming trainers in their home institutions. This commitment entails conducting at least one Cybersecurity Institute (CI) workshop or integrating the training modules into their classes/research groups within one year of completing the Summer Institute.
5. **Dedicated Participation**: Selected FTs will receive stipends and travel cost defrayal during their participation in the Summer Institute. This support is provided to ensure participants have dedicated time to focus on the training.
6. **Equity and Inclusion**: The Principal Investigators (PIs) will take special measures to ensure the participation of underrepresented population groups.
