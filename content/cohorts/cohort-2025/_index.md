T3-CIDERS is a year-long train-the-trainer (T3) program infusing solid competencies in CI and pedagogical skills. Activities of T3-CIDERS are designed to be synergistic with research, teaching, and learning activities carried out by faculty, postdocs, and graduate students. The primary target disciplines are the cybersecurity and cyber-related fields.

In brief, the T3-CIDERS training program in academic year 2025–2026 consists of the following:
***ALL DATES ARE CURRENTLY TENTATIVE***

- **Pre-training** (Oct–Nov 2025): A series of virtual events and training programs will be conducted to provide background knowledge and skills as an introduction to the technical contents of T3-CIDERS.

- **Winter Institute** (Jan 5–9, 2024): A week-long in-person program will be carried out to inculcate instructional (pedagogical) skills in order to teach cyberinfrastructure (CI) skills to students in the context of cybersecurity research.

- **Local Training** (Spring/Fall 2026): With support from the T3-CIDERS team, future trainers will plan and conduct local training events at their local institutions and/or communities to increase the uptake of CI techniques and platforms and enable rapid advances in cybersecurity and cyber-related research, development, and training.

- **Outreach to Local High Schools** (Spring/Fall 2026): Future trainers are encouraged to offer outreach seminars or activities to increase awareness of cybersecurity research and CI among high school students in order to pique their interest in pursuing careers in these fields.

- **Development of New CI Training Modules** (ongoing): Future trainers will be enabled to develop additional CI training modules that will accelerate research in new areas in cybersecurity and cyber-related areas.
